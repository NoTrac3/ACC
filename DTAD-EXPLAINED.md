ACC - Advanced Cyber Crime Protection Bot

Finally, a Discord security system that actually works.

What if you could stop raiders before they even get in? What if your server could automatically detect and blocks known threats the moment they try to join?

That's exactly what ACC does.

We've built an enterprise-grade protection system that makes raiding attempts completely useless.

🚀 WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT:

• 1,800+ pre-loaded blacklisted threats in our database
• Real-time cross-server intelligence sharing
• Instant detection - blocks threats in milliseconds
• Automated kick/ban for known raiders
• Advanced spam detection that actually learns
• Works across 55+ servers simultaneously

🛡️ PROTECTION THAT DOESN'T SLEEP:

The moment a known raider tries to join your server, they're gone. Instantly. No waiting for mods to wake up. No manual reports needed.

Our system shares threat intelligence across all protected servers. When one server finds a new threat, every server knows about it immediately.

📊 ENTERPRISE POWER, SIMPLE SETUP:

This isn't some basic moderation bot. We're running:
• 1,000+ entries per second processing
• Self-healing database systems
• Real-time analytics and reporting
• Automatic backup and recovery

But you don't need to understand any of that. Just invite the bot, run a few setup commands, and your server is protected.

🎯 KEY FEATURES:

• _add_blacklist - Add threats to the global database
• _network_stats - See real-time protection metrics
• _dtads - Check if a user is blacklisted
• Auto-kick/ban - Fully configurable protection
• Spam detection - Smart systems that stop mention spam
• Bulk management - Handle thousands of entries at once

🔍 REAL RESULTS:

Imagine this: A raider tries to attack a protected server. Within 100 milliseconds, they're kicked. Instantly, every other protected server now knows about this raider. Their entire attack fails in seconds, and their accounts are now useless against our entire network.

That's not theory - that's what actually happens.

🚨 FOR SERVER OWNERS:

Tired of worrying about raids? Sick of cleaning up after attacks? We get it. That's why we built ACC.

Your community is valuable. Protect it with the same technology that Fortune 500 companies use. Except we made it simple enough for any Discord server.

💡 QUICK START:

1. Invite ACC to your server
2. Run _settings to configure protection
3. Set up your log channels
4. That's it - you're protected

No complicated setup. No technical knowledge needed. Just real protection that works 24/7.

Join the growing network of protected communities. Stop worrying about raids and focus on what matters - building your community.

The age of successful Discord raids is over.
