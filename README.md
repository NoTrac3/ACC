**ACC - Advanced Community Control** 🛡️

## **The Blacklist That Actually Works**

You know how it goes... you see a spam link, you ban it, and tomorrow there's another one just like it. It feels like you're constantly playing catch-up while the spammers are always one step ahead.

### **Here's the Game-Changer**

Most bots make you manually ban every single domain. That's like trying to stop a flood with a teacup. With ACC, when you blacklist one domain, you're actually protecting your server from an entire network of related threats.

### **How It Works in Plain English**

**Traditional Blacklist:**
- You see "badsite.com" spamming your server
- You ban "badsite.com"
- Tomorrow "badsite.net" shows up
- You ban that too
- Then "badsite.org" appears...
- It never ends

**ACC Networked Protection:**
- You ban "badsite.com"
- ACC automatically learns patterns from that domain
- It now recognizes "badsite.net", "badsite.org", and similar variations
- Future spam attempts from related domains get blocked automatically
- You get protected from domains you haven't even seen yet

### **Real Example That Actually Happened**

One of our users runs a gaming server. They kept getting hit with "free-roblox-generator" sites. Every day, a new variation:

- free-roblox-generator.com
- free-roblox-generator.net  
- get-free-roblox.com
- roblox-rewards-generator.com

With normal bots, they'd have to ban each one manually. With ACC, they banned the first one, and the system automatically caught the next 12 variations that showed up over the next week.

### **What This Means For You**

**As a Server Owner:**
- Stop spending hours maintaining blacklists
- Actually get ahead of spammers for once
- Protect your members from new threats automatically
- Feel confident that your community is safe

**As a Moderator:**
- Spend less time playing domain whack-a-mole
- Focus on actual community management
- Have a system that learns from your actions
- Get smarter protection over time

**As a Member:**
- Fewer spam links cluttering your chats
- Less risk of clicking malicious links
- Cleaner, safer conversation spaces

### **The Best Part - It Gets Smarter**

The more you use ACC, the better it gets at recognizing spam patterns. It's like having a security guard that learns the spammers' tricks and stops them before they even try.

### **Simple Commands, Powerful Protection**

Just use:
`_antispam blacklist spamsite.com`

And you're not just banning one domain - you're shutting down an entire spam operation.

### **Why This Actually Works Where Others Fail**

Most anti-spam systems treat each domain as completely separate. But spammers don't work that way - they use patterns, similar naming conventions, and related domains.

ACC understands that "free-discord-nitro.com" and "free-discord-nitro.net" are probably the same spam operation, and protects you from both when you only banned one.

### **The Bottom Line**

You're tired of constantly updating blacklists. You're frustrated that spammers always seem to be one step ahead. You want protection that actually understands how spammers work.

ACC's networked blacklist system finally gives you the upper hand. It's not just reacting to spam - it's anticipating it.

**Stop fighting spam domains one-by-one. Start protecting your entire community with a single command.**

*"I used to ban 5-10 new spam domains every week. With ACC, I banned one, and it automatically blocked 20 related domains over the next month. It's like having a mod who never sleeps."* - Gaming Server Owner
